<h1 align="center"> <br>Software Development Project Portfolio</h1>

<p> Welcome to my Software Development Project Portfolio. This is the repository that contains all of my performed projects and lessons achieved.
The projects were done throughout my Systems Engineering Career at UTN FRBA (Universidad Tecnologica Nacional, Facultad Regional Buenos Aires). Some of them were done independently and others with the colaboration of a team. </p>

The languages used were: C++, C, Haskell, Prolog, Flex, Bison.

<h1> Projects🫱🏻‍🫲🏼</h1>
<ul>
<li><h2><a href = "https://github.com/JulianT52/Projects-in-UTN.BA/tree/main/tp-2025-1c-Junior-Engineers">Operative System Workspace </h2></li> <p> This was my first teamwork project. Here i learned the basic principles of programming and values that I seek to faithfully represent today, such as teamwork, good communication and efficient organization of time. The project entails a system builded by 4 modules that connect with eachother and sends packages to simulate the execution cycle of a Operative System. </p>
<li><h2><a href = "https://github.com/JulianT52/Projects-in-UTN.BA/tree/main/Programming Paradigms">Programming Paradigms⌨️</h2></li>
  <p> This groups of projects have the objetive of solving a problem specified in a work order. Every project shows me the importance of program codes that need to be 
specific, declarative, without repetition of logic and above all, non-redundant. The objetive of some of these programs is to perform calculations and show results based on certain parameters.</p>
